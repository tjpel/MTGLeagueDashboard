This web application was made by Thomas Pelowitz with help from Clay Eitel.\n
This application has no official connection to, or support from, Midwest Vintage Toys. It was made as a fun project to give back to a great community of players.\n
Please direct all questions and suggestions to Thomas (tjpel on Discord). All suggestions will be considered within the scope and purpose of this for-fun project.\n
All are welcome to contribute! This site is written in Python 3.11 using the Streamlit library. [Code is available here](https://github.com/tjpel/MTGLeagueDashboard)!
